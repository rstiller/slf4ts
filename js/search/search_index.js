\n\n\nThis is the mono-repository for the slf4ts modules.slf4ts modules are a collection of modules abstracting logging for nodejs libraries.  \nCompatible libraries use the slf4ts-api module to get a Logger instance and do the logging.The application, that use these libraries, choose a concrete logging library alongside thecorresponding slf4ts logger binding module to make their dependencies use the chosen logging library.\nModules\n\n\n\nModule\nDescription\nStatus\nLink\n\n\n\n\n\nslf4ts-api\nAPI / interface module\n\n\n  \n\n\nBindings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nslf4ts-bunyan\nBunyan Logger

used to abstract loggingto develop reusable libraries and not force the usageof a certain logging framework.\nIt's meant to be used with nodejs.\nLogLevel\n\nTRACE (numeric value: 4)\nDEBUG (numeric value: 3)\nINFO (numeric value: 2)\nWARN (numeric value: 1)\nERROR (numeric value: 0)\n\nLogger Implementations\nslf4ts doesn't work without a logging-framework binding.Bindings exist for a couple of logging-frameworks:\n\nconsole\nlog4js\nwinston\n\nWrite a binding\nA binding for a logging-framework needs to implement the LoggerBinding interface andthe actual logger interface LoggerImplementation.   \nAlso a file named .slf4ts-binding needs to be present in the package folder (can be empty).   \nA node package for a binding should export a single function that is used during binding discovery.\nInterfaces to implement:\nimport { LogLevel } from \"slf4ts-api\";\n\ninterface LoggerImplementation {\n    log(...args: any[]): Promise;\n    getImplementation(): T;\n    setConfig(config: T, group: string, name: string): void;\n    setLogLevel(logLevel: LogLevel, group: string, name: string): void;\n    setMetadata(metadata: any, group: string, name: string): void;\n}\n\ninterface LoggerBinding {\n    getLoggerImplementation(): LoggerImplementation;\n    getVendor(): string;\n    getVersion(): string;\n}Sample implementation in typescript (index.ts):\nimport { LoggerBindings } from \"slf4ts-api\";\n\nexport default function(bindings: LoggerBindings) {\n    bindings.registerBinding({\n        getLoggerImplementation: () => { ... },\n        getVendor: () => \"My Logger Binding Implementation\",\n        getVersion: () => \"1.0.0\"\n    });\n}\nAn example implementation can be found in the example-node-modules folder of this project.\nUsage\nimport { LoggerConfiguration, LogLevel, LoggerFactory } from \"slf4ts-api\";\n\n// gets the root logger (group \"\" and name \"\")\nconst ROOT_LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger();\n\nclass X {\n\n    // gets a logger with group \"my-lib\" and name \"X\"\n    private static LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(\"my-lib\", \"X\");\n\n    public async something(value: any) {\n        // log with debug level and some metadata\n        X.LOG.debug(`a message with ${value}`, { additionalData: \"Testvalue\" });\n\n        try {\n            ...\n        } catch(error: Error) {\n            // logs an error without metadata\n            X.LOG.error('Error!', error);\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\n// sets the log level of all loggers\nLoggerConfiguration.setLogLevel(LogLevel.INFO);\n\n// sets the log level of all loggers within group \"my-lib\"\nLoggerConfiguration.setLogLevel(LogLevel.WARN, \"my-lib\");\n\n// sets the log level of the logger with group \"my-lib\" and name \"X\"\nLoggerConfiguration.setLogLevel(LogLevel.ERROR, \"my-lib\", \"X\");\n\nconst config = {\n    transports: [...],\n    events: [...],\n    postProcessor: () => { ... }\n};\n\n// sets the config of all loggers\nLoggerConfiguration.setConfig(config);\n\n// sets the config of all loggers within group
